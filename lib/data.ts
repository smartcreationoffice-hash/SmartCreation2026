export const faqs: Faq[] = [
  {
    q: "How long does it take to set up a company in Dubai?",
    a: "A straightforward free-zone company is usually licensed within 3–10 working days. Mainland LLCs take 7–14 days depending on activity approvals. DIFC, which requires regulatory review, typically takes 4–6 weeks. The visa cycle adds another two to three weeks after licensing.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can foreigners own 100% of a UAE company?",
    a: "Yes. Every free zone has always allowed 100% foreign ownership. Since 2021 the UAE has extended 100% foreign ownership to most mainland activities as well, so unless your business falls under a short list of strategic sectors, you will not need a local partner.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is the most cost-effective way to set up in the UAE?",
    a: "For a solo consultant, freelancer, or digital business, a free zone like IFZA, Meydan, Ajman FZ, or SHAMS can start from AED 12,500–18,000 per year for the license, with the option to add a single investor visa. We will quote the all-in cost on the first call: license, visa, Emirates ID, and our fee.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the difference between mainland and free zone?",
    a: "A mainland license (issued by Dubai's DET or another emirate's DED) lets you trade anywhere in the UAE and directly contract with the federal government. A free zone license lets you trade internationally and within your zone, with tax and customs benefits, but requires a local distributor to trade onshore for goods. For most service businesses, both work; the choice comes down to cost, visa quota, and where your customers are.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to be physically in the UAE to start the process?",
    a: "No. We can begin licensing and name reservation remotely with a Power of Attorney and notarised passport copies. You typically need to be in the UAE for 1–3 working days for biometrics, Emirates ID, and bank-account KYC.",
  },
  {
    q: "Am I eligible for the UAE Golden Visa?",
    a: "You may qualify as an investor (AED 2 million in real estate or a qualifying business), as a skilled professional (with a salary threshold and accredited qualification), or under the entrepreneur, scientist, or talent categories. We assess eligibility on the first call and handle the full application.",
  },
  {
    q: "What does Corporate Tax mean for my UAE company?",
    a: "Since 1 June 2023 most UAE businesses pay 9% Corporate Tax on taxable income above AED 375,000. Qualifying free-zone entities that meet the substance and qualifying-income tests can still benefit from a 0% rate on eligible income. We handle registration, transfer-pricing documentation, and annual filing.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's included in your PRO services?",
    a: "Establishment card, visa issuance and renewal, Emirates ID, medical fitness, labour-card processing, document attestation (MOFA, embassy), notarisation, trademark filing, and any liaison with MOHRE, GDRFA, or the relevant free-zone authority. Monthly retainers available.",
