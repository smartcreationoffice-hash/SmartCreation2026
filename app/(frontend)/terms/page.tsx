          Smart Creation provides U.A.E. business-setup, banking-introduction,
          visa, accounting, audit, Corporate Tax, real-estate and related
          professional services. The exact scope of any engagement is set out
          in a written proposal or service agreement that we send before the
          work begins. That document, together with any change order signed
          afterwards, governs what we deliver.

          We do not provide legal, tax or accounting advice within the meaning
          of any regulated profession, and nothing on this website or in our
          communications should be relied on as such. Where a regulated
          opinion is needed, we will refer you to a licensed practitioner.

          you, not by us.

        <p>
          Payment terms, refund rules and cancellation conditions are governed
