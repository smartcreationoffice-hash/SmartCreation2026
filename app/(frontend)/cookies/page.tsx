          Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device when
          you visit them. They make sites work, remember preferences and help
          owners understand how their pages are used. Some cookies last only
          while your browser is open (session cookies), others persist for
          longer (persistent cookies).

          We keep our cookie footprint minimal. The cookies we set fall into
          three categories:

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium text-ink">Strictly necessary</span> —
            cookies that the site needs to function (admin session, security
            tokens, hosting load-balancing). These cannot be turned off
            through this policy. If you disable them in your browser, parts
            of the admin panel will not work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium text-ink">Functional</span> — remember
            your preferences such as language, recently viewed business
            centers or the position of the WhatsApp button.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium text-ink">Analytics</span> — aggregate,
            anonymised information about how the site is used (which pages
            are visited, how long, on which device). We use this to improve
            page speed, layout and content. We do not use analytics cookies
            to profile individual visitors for advertising.

          set their own cookies:

            business-centre or homepage map is displayed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span className="font-medium text-ink">Supabase</span> — for
            authenticated sessions on the admin panel only.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We do not run advertising cookies, retargeting pixels or
          cross-site trackers.
